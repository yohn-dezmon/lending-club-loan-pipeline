Pros --> very fast... for analytical and reporting purposes
Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) which allows you to load
data quickly.

Redshift distributes and parallelizes your queries across
multiple nodes.

Horizontally scalable!


CONS
Can’t be used as live app database – While Redshift is very fast when running queries on a huge amount of data or running reporting and analytics, but it is not fast enough for live web apps. So you will have to pull data into a caching layer or a vanilla Postgres instance to serve redshift data to web apps.

Requires a good understanding of Sort and Dist keys
