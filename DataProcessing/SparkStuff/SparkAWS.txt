Starting Up Spark Cluster:

name == spark_loan
master = 1
workers = 2
m4.large
security group = computing 2

$ cd ~/Desktop/DevPortfolio/Insight-Data-Fellowship/Pegasus/pegasus/examples/spark/
$ . ~/.bashrc
# enable the ssh agent
$ eval `ssh-agent -s`

ok before even doing this, what needs to be set up on AWS?

1a. VPC:
On the default tab, “VPC with a Single Public Subnet”, click Select. (The subnet is a subset of the whole AWS network that is available.)
On “Step 2”, you’ll need to change a few bits of information:
IPv4 CIDR Block: 10.0.0.0/26
VPC Name: my-name-vpc
Public Subnet’s IPv4 CIDR: 10.0.0.0/28
Everything else can be left as the default
Then click “Create VPC”

1. Security Group
